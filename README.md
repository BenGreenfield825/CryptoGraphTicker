# CryptoGraphTicker
## *WIP*
## Intro
This repo is the software for a raspberry-pi based cryptocurrency price and graph ticker. This code allows a user to
choose between different formats of data, i.e. switching between price charts, viewing different coin prices, viewing
information from a user's crypto account, etc.

## FAQ
### Why not use CoinMarketCap?
The coinmarketcap api requires the use of a key which requires an account to generate, while the CoinbasePro api does 
not. I also wanted to use it as I personally use CoinbasePro, so I can pull personal data related to my account if
I want to (or any user if you change the settings in this project). The output to the ticker is also only on a *n* minute
update interval, so speed and precise data isn't required.

## Possible Todo's
- include live price updating functionality
